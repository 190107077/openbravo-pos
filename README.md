## How to compile?

You can download Netbeans from [here](http://www.netbeans.org). And there is a quick guide to develop with Netbeans [here](http://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/java/quickstart.html).

1. To create a new Netbeans project with the Openbravo sources, open Netbeans and select _New project..._ to open the new project wizard, select _Java Project with Existing Sources_ and press _Next_.
2. In the following step select the project name and the folder where the Netbeans project files will be stored and press _Next_. Do not select the same folder you checked out the sources.
3. In the following step select the source folders. Add the folders _locales_, _reports_, _src-beans_, _src-data_, _src-erp_, and _src-pos_. In this step you can press _Finish_.
4. The next step is to add the libraries needed to build and execute Openbravo POS. Open the _Properties..._ dialog of the project and in the libraries section add all the *.jar files of the folder _libs_.
5. Now you have ready a Netbeans project configured than you can edit, build and test. To execute and debug Openbravo POS you need also to select the main class of the project. Open the _Properties..._ dialog and in the run section Openbravo select `com.openbravo.pos.forms.StartPOS` as the Main Class and press _OK_.
